# It-s-PCG-Time
This project is a Unity project which contains three different content generators, each in their own scene.
In each of the scenes there exists a game object with generator in the name, the generation is done by these objects.
To run the generators you simply run the program. If the program is already running pressing space will run the generator again.
Each generator contains scripts with variables that can be altered to effect the final product. 
The scripts that can be edited are the Interpolator, Height Map Generator, Agent Generator, Agent Manager and the Maze Generator.
Terrain meshes are generated by both the agent generator and the terrain generator, the maze generator outputs a maze in the console.
